give my python code using only numpy and COBYLA which reads in iris data set, constructs ML classifier consisting of 3 layers of fully connected network  4-5-3. The last layer should represent the 3 classes of iris hot encoded. COBYLA should be used as minimizer

ChatGPT4:
To create a Python code for a machine learning classifier using only NumPy and the COBYLA optimizer, you can follow these steps. Note that this will be a simplified example, as building a neural network from scratch without using specialized libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch is quite involved.

Here's an outline of what we need to do:

Load the Iris dataset.
Preprocess the dataset: normalize the features and one-hot encode the labels.
Define the neural network architecture.
Implement the forward pass function.
Define the loss function.
Use COBYLA from SciPy to optimize the weights.
(the code follows)

Jan:
Add to this code a call-back function which will accumulate loss vs. iteration. Print it as table at the end
Now change this code to use cross entropy for loss
reduce number of epochs to 100
